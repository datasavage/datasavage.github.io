In this project, we look at some data and analyse it in an interesting way.

## Project 2: [Machine Learning Application](/projects/project_2.py)

In this project, we apply a state of the art machine learning algorithm to a data set to generate predictions. The results surpass everything thought possible.

## Project 3: [Autonomous Driving](/projects/project_3.py)

In this project, we implement an artificial intelligence for autonomous driving. In real live tests our implementation outperformed all human drivers, proving it to be a much safer alternative for the future.
